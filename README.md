# My First Portfolio

This is my first portfolio website project, created as part of my HTML learning journey.

## Project Description

This project is a simple, multi-page website built with only HTML. It includes a homepage, a page for tweets, and a structured portfolio page. The goal was to practice fundamental HTML concepts such as:

* **HTML Structure**: Using `DOCTYPE`, `head`, and `body` tags.
* **Text Formatting**: Using paragraphs (`<p>`), headings (`<h1>` to `<h3>`), and lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`).
* **Links and Navigation**: Creating hyperlinks (`<a>`) to connect different pages and external sites.
* **Images**: Embedding images (`<img>`) and making them clickable.
* **Semantic HTML**: Structuring the pages with `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` for better organization and accessibility.
* **Tables**: Creating a table (`<table>`) with a header (`<thead>`) and body (`<tbody>`) to display data.
* **W3C Compliance**: Ensuring the code is valid and well-formed according to W3C standards.

## Files

* `base_index.html`: The most basic, valid HTML file.
* `index.html`: The main homepage of the project. It contains paragraphs, headings, a clickable image, a link to the tweets page, and a table of learners.
* `tweets.html`: A page dedicated to embedding a tweet and linking back to the homepage.
* `portfolio/index.html`: A personal portfolio page with sections for introduction, projects, about me, and contact information, built using semantic HTML.

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply open any of the `.html` files in your web browser.
